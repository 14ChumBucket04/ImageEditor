# Image Editing Project using Pillow

This project is a simple image editing script written in Python using the Pillow library (PIL fork). It applies various image editing techniques such as sharpening, black and white conversion, rotation, contrast adjustment, blurring, brightness adjustment, and sharpness adjustment to a collection of images.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to explore the capabilities of the Pillow library for image processing tasks.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
    ```
    pip install pillow
    ```
3. Place the images you want to edit in the `imgs` folder within the project directory.
4. Run the script `image_editor.py`.
5. Edited images will be saved in the `editedImgs` folder.

## File Structure

- `image_editor.py`: Python script containing the image editing code.
- `imgs/`: Folder containing the original, unedited images.
- `editedImgs/`: Folder where the edited images will be saved.

## Dependencies

- **Pillow (Python Imaging Library)**: This library is used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

## Customization

You can customize the editing process by adjusting parameters such as contrast, brightness, and sharpness factors in the script to achieve desired results.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the contributors of the Pillow library for providing such a powerful image processing tool.
